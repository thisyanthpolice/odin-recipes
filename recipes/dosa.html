   <h2>Description: </h2>
   <p>
    <strong>Dosa</strong> is a popular South Indian dish that is widely enjoyed across India and around the world. It is a thin, crispy, and savory pancake made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram) batter. The batter is typically ground into a smooth paste and left to ferment overnight, which helps develop its characteristic tangy flavor and airy texture.</p>
<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>rice - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Urad Dal (Black Gram Lentils) - 1/4 cup</li>
    <li>Fenugreek Seeds - 1/2 teaspoon (optional)</li>
    <li>Water - As needed</li>
    <li>Salt - To taste</li>
    <li>Oil or Ghee (Clarified Butter) - For greasing the pan</li>
</ul>
<h3>steps: </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Soak the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) in water for 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Drain the soaked ingredients and grind them into a smooth batter, adding water as needed. The batter should have a thick yet pourable consistency.</li>
    <li>Allow the batter to ferment for 8-12 hours or overnight at room temperature. The batter should rise and become slightly tangy.</li>
    <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently and add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick griddle or tawa over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>
    <li>Pour a ladle of batter onto the hot griddle and spread it into a thin, circular shape.</li>
    <li>Cook the dosa on one side until it turns golden brown and crispy. Optionally, drizzle a little more oil or ghee around the edges for added crispiness.</li>
    <li>If making masala dosa, prepare the filling by saut√©ing onions, green chilies, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and turmeric. Add boiled and mashed potatoes, and cook until well-mixed. Season with salt and coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>If desired, place the masala filling in the center of the dosa, fold it over, and serve.</li>
    <li>Serve the dosa with chutneys (such as coconut chutney, tomato chutney) and sambar.</li>
  </ol>
